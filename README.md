This was is a collectin of scripts and code I found to help me write a launch script for my craft.

Launch.ks is the big launch script. It does it everything need to get to a circular orbit and it works.

Murica.ks is a "midi player" I was wroking on. You transpose a song (or each part) to a list of notes and this will play it with basic generated tones. It can even play cords!
